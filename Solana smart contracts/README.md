# Stoke NFT solana smart contract structure.

This is for our front-end engineers to understand how this contract folder interacts with our website.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU CAN EDIT, REPLACE OR DELETE ANYTHING YOU FIND REDUNDANT OR UNIMPORTANT IN THE JS FOLDER THAT HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS  FRONT-END FILES IN ORDER TO AVOID COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. MAJORITY OF THE FRONT END FILES WERE GOTTEN FROM METAPLEX STOREFRONT CREATOR AS A TEMPLATE TO SHOW YOU HOW MY SMART CONTRACTS REACT WITH A STORE FRONT(BECAUSE METAPLEX IS THE LEADING STANDARD IN SOLANA STORE FRONT CREATION).



## Solana Breakdown
This folder contains two parts,

1. An on-chain Solana smart contract coded in rust. (The program folder) is the core Solana code, and some Metaplex contracts were added for security and efficiency.



2. An off-chain code coupled with Solana web3 JS files in (The JS folder). This is where front-end integration meets the smart contracts and therefore is the subject of this readme file.
 
## CLI FOLDER
This is the back-end off-chain folder, made with Anchor that helps the JS folder communicate with the smart contracts & and the Solana network, it contains instructions & processes for minting and sales. Candy Machine CLI is the back end code for Minting and the fair-launch folder is the back end code for auctions and fixed sale listings.
